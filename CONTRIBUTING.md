# Contributing guidelines

We love contributions! If you want to help build and improve our project, please read
the following guidelines before submitting your contributions.

## Code of Conduct

[Please read our Code of Conduct before contributing][docs-code-of-conduct].

## Conventions

All code must be version-controlled using Git, and regularly pushed to GitHub. Git
branches are cheap, and commits can be squashed, or fixed-up later on. As such, please
push code, including work-in-progress code, at regular intervals.

You should regularly rebase or merge code from `main` into your feature branch. This
ensures you have the latest accepted/reviewed changes, reduces future conflicts, and
that your developments will not break these accepted changes. Only merge new changes in
if your code is being used by other contributors. For example, do not rebase new
changes into a branch currently in review.

## Contributing requirements

To contribute to this project, please make sure your system meets the following
requirements:

- Git 2.36+ installed
- Python 3.9+ installed
- [Poetry 1.2 installed][poetry]
- a local clone of this project
  ```zsh
  git clone https://github.com/ESKYoung/cookiecutter-machine-learning.git  # HTTPS
  git clone git@github.com:ESKYoung/cookiecutter-machine-learning.git  # SSH
  ```
- [pre-commit hooks installed](#pre-commit-hooks)
- [`act` installed to test GitHub Actions locally](#continuous-integrationcontinuous-deployment-cicd)

Now, install the Poetry virtual environment, including all optional dependency groups.

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
poetry install --with=ci-cd,docs,pre-commit,testing --sync
```

Alternatively, run the following `make` command:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
make contributor_requirements
```

## Pre-commit hooks

Pre-commit hooks to ensure consistency, and security in our code before it enters
version control.

Run the following commands once, to always install pre-commit hooks for any project
that supports them (recommended):

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
git config --global init.templateDir ~/.git-template
pre-commit init-templatedir ~/.git-template
```

To install pre-commit hooks on a per-project basis, run this command:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
pre-commit install
```

The following hooks are enabled for this project:

| Pre-commit hook name                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

These hooks can be configured in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file; please refer to
the `pre-commit` documentation, and the individual packages used for these hooks for
further information.

## Testing

[Tests are written using `pytest`][pytest], and can be found in the `tests` folder.
These tests check code written in the `hooks`, and `src` folder. To run the tests, open
your terminal, and run the following commands:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
pytest
```

For code written within the `src` folder, we expect code coverage of at least 90%. You
can view the coverage report by opening your terminal, and running the following
commands:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
pytest --cov --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

Alternatively, run the following `make` command:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
make coverage_report
```

[We use `nox` to handle testing on multiple Python versions][nox] to ensure
compatibility. All `nox` sessions can be run by opening the terminal, and running the
following commands:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
nox
```

This runs the following `nox` sessions:

| Session name | Description                                                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_example`   | Build an example project called `Example Project`, and run its `nox` sessions.            |
| `docs`       | Checks the Sphinx documentation builds correctly, and that external hyperlinks are valid. |
| `pre-commit` | [Runs pre-commit hooks on all files](#pre-commit-hooks).                                  |
| `testing`    | Runs the entire pytest suite.                                                             |

To run individual `nox` session(s), add the `session` flag followed by the name of the
session(s) with space separators, for example:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
nox --session pre-commit testing
```

These `nox` sessions are also [run as part of the CI/CD process using GitHub
Actions](#continuous-integrationcontinuous-deployment-cicd). For ease, the `nox`
session name is identical to any required Poetry dependency group so that GitHub
Actions can easily install the correct dependencies, and run `nox` sessions in
parallel. Sessions that do not require any Poetry dependency groups are named with a
`_` prefix. See the configuration script at `.github/workflows.yml` for further details.

## Documentation

Documentation in this project is written in Markdown, and [parsed by MyST-Parser and to
build a searchable HTML documentation website][myst-parser].

To build, and view the `Sphinx` documentation in the `docs` folder locally, run the
following commands, which will also open the documentation homepage in your browser:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
sphinx-build --builder=html docs docs/_build
open docs/_build/index.html
```

Alternatively, run the following `make` command:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
make build_docs
```

### Writing documentation

Documentation should be written in clear, and plain English. Although contentious, we
try to wrap lines at 88 characters; this can allow for easier review of raw Markdown,
although arguably Git diffs can become more complicated.

[Try to use reference-style external links][markdown-external-links] wherever possible,
as this makes the raw Markdown easier to read. Also try to avoid linking to the same
place more than once. [For content writing guidance, refer to GOV.UK's Content Design
pages][govuk-content-writing].

Please refer to the MyST-Parser documentation pages on how to include Sphinx-related
components in the outputted HTML website. This includes notes, warnings, images, and
including Markdown files from outside the `docs` folder.

Detailed guidance should be stored in, and referenced from the `docs` folder.
High-level documentation, such as the `README.md`, and this file, should be stored at
the root-level of the repository, and included in `docs` using MyST-Parser. For an
example, see how the `README.md` is included by using MyST-Parser in `docs/index.md`.

[Sphinx is configured in the `docs/conf.py` file][sphinx]; please refer to their
documentation for further information. Note that the CI/CD process will automatically
check for valid external links. If you need to ignore any external links from this
checker, add a valid regular expression pattern to the `linkcheck_ignore` variable in
`docs/conf.py`

## Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)

[This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD processes][github-actions]. The following
GitHub Action workflows are enabled:

| Name                      | Event trigger | Description                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `nox`                     | `push`        | Runs `nox` sessions across multiple Python versions (3.9+), and on Ubuntu and macOS for every `git push`.                |
| `sphinx-build-and-deploy` | `released`    | Builds, and deploys `Sphinx` documentation to GitHub Pages when a release is published on GitHub. Excludes pre-releases. |

[Install `act` to your system to test GitHub Actions locally before pushing to
GitHub][act]. Note `act` tests GitHub Actions using Ubuntu runners, so any macOS runs
will be skipped. By default, calling:

```zsh
act
```

runs GitHub Actions with the `push` event trigger. Other event triggers can be invoked
with additional arguments, for example:

```zsh
act release
```

will run GitHub Actions with the `release` event trigger.

## Modifying this `cookiecutter`-based project

[This project uses the `cookiecutter` Python package to build a template for machine
learning projects][cookiecutter]. Additionally, [we use the `cruft` Python package to
help update projects created from this template][cruft].

This template can be found in the `{{ cookiecutter.repository_name }}` folder. All
files in this template folder will be in any created project.

[Files inside the template folder may have Jinja placeholders][jinja]; with
user-inputted values during the prompts, these placeholders allow us to:

- pre-populate code, and other files
- add conditional sections of code
- add conditional files
- run commands

To learn more about Jinja templating, refer to the `cookiecutter` and/or Jinja
documentation.

At the root-level of this repository, you will find a `hooks`, and `src` folder. The
`hooks` folder contains any pre- or post-generation hooks. The `src` folder contains
any extra code required by this project when creating the templates.

Pre- and post-generation hooks are scripts that `cookiecutter` will run either before
(pre-generation), or after (post-generation) creating a project from the template. If
one or more pre-generation hooks fail, no project will be created from the template. If
one or more post-generation hooks fail, the created project will be automatically
cleaned up. Refer to the `cookiecutter` documentation for more information about these
hooks.

Note that modifying files outside the template folder, will not change those inside
the template folder. For example, if you would like to implement a new pre-commit hook
for this project, as well as for any downstream projects created from the template, you
must add the new hook to both `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and
`{{ cookiecutter.repository_name }}/.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
