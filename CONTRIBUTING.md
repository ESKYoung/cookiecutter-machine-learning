# Contributing guidelines

We love contributions! If you want to help build and improve our project, please read
the following guidelines before submitting your contributions.

## Contributing requirements

To contribute to this project, please make sure your system meets the following
requirements:

- Git 2.36+ installed
- Python 3.9+ installed
- [Poetry 1.2 installed][poetry]
- a local clone of this project
  ```zsh
  git clone https://github.com/ESKYoung/cookiecutter-machine-learning.git  # HTTPS
  git clone git@github.com:ESKYoung/cookiecutter-machine-learning.git  # SSH
  ```
- [pre-commit hooks installed](#pre-commit-hooks)

Now, install the Poetry virtual environment, including all optional dependency groups.

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
poetry install --with=ci-cd,pre-commit,testing
```

## Pre-commit hooks

pre-commit hooks to ensure consistency, and security in our code before it enters
version control.

Run the following commands once, to always install pre-commit hooks for any project
that supports them (recommended):

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
git config --global init.templateDir ~/.git-template
pre-commit init-templatedir ~/.git-template
```

To install pre-commit hooks on a per-project basis, run this command:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
pre-commit install
```

The following hooks are enabled for this project:

| Pre-commit hook name                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
