# Pre-commit hooks

[Pre-commit hooks ensure consistency, and security in our code before it enters version
control](https://pre-commit.com).

Run the following commands once to always install pre-commit hooks for any project that
supports them (recommended):

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
git config --global init.templateDir ~/.git-template
pre-commit init-templatedir ~/.git-template
```

To install pre-commit hooks on a per-project basis, run this command:

```zsh
cd /path/to/repository
pre-commit install
```

The following hooks are enabled for this project:

| Pre-commit hook name                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
